# Data-Security_D3_IS428
The visualization project of IS428 using D3.

Our project objective is to provide IT security department or Individual e.g. analysts with this analytical web application 

i.	To assess the spread and impact of pre-exisitng security threats e.g. is it only prevalent in certain regions, is it of high data sensitivity, creating repercussions in the various industries such as enterprise, government etc. 
ii.	To provide early warning of the new threat vectors (if any)
iii.	To discover the source of penetrators and its method of leak e.g. hacks, lost. If hack, we would seek to gain insight on the attack vectors e.g. social engineering, application or system vulnerability or does it coincide with security news such as availability of zero-day vulnerability like heartbleed bug etc. 
iv.	To discover the pattern of modus operandi (analogue to a serial killer) (if any). 

In doing so, the end users (be it IT Security or security analyst) could better devise security policies to harden the necessary perimeters of their networks, systems, applications or to even educate the normal users. The bottom line is to counteract Cyber threats with effective security measures. 
Food for thoughts: 
1. Kind of data breaches 
2. Any persistent or growing threat of breaches in specific industry 
3. Accountability of data breaches 
4. Weakest link in the security ecosystem
